	<p>Job title: Developer</p>
    <p>This is my final project for GSND 6340 Biometrics for Design at Northeastern University. The designer and I have the idea of playing Flappy Bird with actual swing the arms as bird wings, so we decided to recreated the Flappy Bird on Unity with XBox Kinect. In the game, player needs to flap their arms upside down (or reverse) and the bird will make a flap. For more documention, please check this <a href="https://biometrics2019.wordpress.com/sky-leap/">page</a>.</p>
	
	<p>In this project, I use Kinect Pro for Unity plug-in to develop the game. I studied the plug-in code and understand how does it works and how should I use it to achieve our goal. Some hardward issue was met during the project development, but I managed to solve this by reading documentation and check other Kinect project. The control of the game is the most annoying issue, but I developed the functionality of detecting one "flap". At the end, we did a lot tunning and made the game playable. </p>
