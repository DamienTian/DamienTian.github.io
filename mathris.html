	<p>Job title: Idea founder, lead designer, prototype developer, UI designer and developer.</p>
    <p>This is my final project for GSND 5110 Game Design and Analysis at Northeastern University. This is a Tetris-inspired game that challenges players to perform simple mathematical calculations to reach progressively larger goals within a set amount of time. The game also features a 2-player mode where players compete against friends or family members to see who can get a higher score in one minute.&nbsp;  </p>
		
    <p>As the idea founder, The initial concept was making a game based on the framework of Tetris. However, I want it to be implemented with the elements of simple math calculations. Calculation symbols such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division were the operators I wanted to put into the game. My main focus is providing the play aesthetics of challenge and submission, much like Tetris. I want the game to be reasonably challenging but not overly complex. I also took inspiration from games like Candy Crush Saga with respect to how we give feedback after a calculation was completed.</p>
		
	<p>After the Idea was set, I started the development on the prototype on Unity. I created a simple Tetris scene and developed math operators' mechanics on it. After a few iterations, I started to works with the team artist on the UI design. I also manage the team progress to make sure all aspects of the development works go well.</p>
