    <p>Job title: Lead Developer, Graphics Tech Support, Visual Effects Designer, Trailer Maker</p>
    <p>This is my Northeastern University thesis project that I am working on with one designer (he is the artist as
      well). This is a 2D platformer game developed in Unity. The main theme of the game is to against school bully, the
      game tells a story about a girl's advantage in her dream and she gain confidence and courage during the advantage.
      The game has total of 3 levels, each level has different theme. Players can see how the girl becomes brave, strong
      and confident by going through her story in the game.</p>

    <p>In this project, I developed the game system and the most of the game objects functionality, the system and game
      objects can be used directly in the Unity with very little modification in the inspector. I also worked with the
      artist on animation and visual effect. I developed a animation listener that can automatically listen the target
      character's animation and play the same animation at the same time, this makes the inside world character's and
      outside world character's animation stay the same when player control either character. I also made the trailer
      using Microsoft Premiere Pro, which is the first trailer I have made.</p>

    <p>Feel free to play it: <a href="https://sidanfan.itch.io/me-behind-the-mirror">Me Behind the Mirror</a>. The game
      supports XBox controller.</p>
