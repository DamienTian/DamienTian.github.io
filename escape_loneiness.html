    <p>Job title: Game AI designer and developer, UI developer, Map designer and developer.</p>
    <p>This is a Global Game Jam (2019) project designed and developed by two students from Northeastern Game Science
      and Design graduate program. This game is about finding similar characters, form a new family and survive from the
      "Loneliness". Inside the game world, the player needs to explore this dark "Loneliness world" and find shapes that
      are same as player's shape. Finding more shape can help player him/herself to survive in the world and help others
      to survive in this "Lonely world". The theme of our game is abstractly related to the THEME of this year: we try
      to represent the "home" with a group that shares similarities, the group members support each other and go through
      hard times. The win condition: In order to win this game, the player needs to find enough "homie" (similar shape)
      and survive in the game world. The lose conditions: Player's loneliness reaches the 100 before enough "homie" were
      found.</p>

    <p>In this project, me and another developer work different aspects of the game (we didn't find a artist or designer
      :( ). I developed game AIs which could follow player, approach to player and stop naturally, and auto format the
      troop when too many "homies" near the player. I created the map and the UI of the game to deliver the feeling of
      walking in an empty town with hard ground where no plant can grows and the feeling of lost in the smog.</p>
