	<p>Job title: Idea founder and developer</p>
    <p>This is my final project for CS 5310 Computer Graphics at Northeastern University. I decided to do this project becasue I wanted to learn more about vertices and edge manipulation, so I team up with another developer to create one part of progressive mesh: progressive edge collasped. In the project, you can see the model of the bunny become less complex but still keeping the bunny shape, the transformation of the mesh is fairly smooth. In this project, I studied many papers about the theories behind the progressive mesh and how to implement it. We spent 20+ hours on this project during the summer weekend (when I have a full-time internship at the same period).    </p>
